My name is Adam Perry. I write some software every once in a while. Been enjoying writing Rust in my recent free time, and I mostly work with Python at the day job. I've also worked previously with Java, C++, JavaScript, and others.

I've worked on projects in areas like bioinformatics and metagenomics, full-stack web applications, JSON/HTTP integrations and scraping, reporting and data analysis, and a few other bits and bobs.

### Contact me

Contact links are below. I'm usually `dikaiosune` on IRC (usually on Mozilla these days in the Rust channels), and `sophrosun3` when I'm occasionally on reddit.
