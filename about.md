My name is Adam Perry. I write some software every once in a while. Been enjoying writing Rust in my recent free time, and I mostly work with Python at the day job. I've also worked previously with Java, a bit of C++, JavaScript, and others.

I've worked on projects in areas like bioinformatics and metagenomics, full-stack web applications, JSON/HTTP integrations and scraping, reporting and data analysis, and a few other bits and bobs. I've recently been enjoying learning more about systems programming via writing Rust in my spare time.

### Hiring?

Having worked in several application domains, I'm interested in many kinds of technical challenges and I'm happy to hear about new opportunities. Email is the best way to reach me (listed in this page's footer). A copy of my resume is linked in the footer.

### Contact me

Contact links are below. I'm usually `dikaiosune` on HN and IRC (usually on Freenode and also irc.mozilla.org in the Rust channels), and `sophrosun3` when I'm occasionally on reddit.
