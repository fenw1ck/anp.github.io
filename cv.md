# Open Source

#### [lolbench](https://github.com/anp/lolbench)

A project to measure the performance of binaries generated by rustc. In the near future we will be able to run a large suite of benchmarks for every merge to master and automatically notify maintainers of potential performance regressions. Work is ongoing at the project repository.

#### [rfcbot](https://github.com/anp/rfcbot-rs)

I'm the author and current maintainer of rfcbot, a tool that helps the Rust teams manage their asynchronous decision making process in the open. Team members can track proposals they need to review at [https://rfcbot.rs](https://rfcbot.rs).

#### Other projects

* [perf_events](https://github.com/anp/perf_events): a crate for instrumenting and profiling Rust code with a safe Rust wrapper around the Linux perf_event_open syscall.
* [rusl](https://github.com/anp/rusl): an experimental partial port of musl libc to Rust. Implements a dynamically linked standard library for C which includes an allocator and many other functions written in Rust, while still passing musl's test suite.
